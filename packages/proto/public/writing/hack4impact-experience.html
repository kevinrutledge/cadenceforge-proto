            <h2>The Assignment</h2>
            <p>
              Fall 2024, first year back at Cal Poly. I joined Hack4Impact and
              got assigned to build a web application for the Hispanic Business
              Association. The stack was Next.js, TypeScript, MongoDB. I'd used
              some of these before. Others were new.
            </p>
            <p>
              The project had designated tech leads. They were learning how to
              lead while also learning the stack. I was one of the developers.
              But as the project went on, I found myself taking most of the
              tickets and writing most of the code.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The Work</h2>
            <p>
              The Hispanic Business Association needed a system for managing
              business profiles and membership. Businesses could update their
              information. Admins could review and approve changes. Members
              needed a way to find and connect with other businesses.
            </p>
            <p>
              I built the admin approval system. Request cards, approval
              workflows, email notifications. The business detail pages with
              membership tracking. The API endpoints for updates and approvals.
              AWS S3 integration for logo uploads. MongoDB schemas for request
              history with TTL-based cleanup.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each feature required understanding how the pieces connected.
              Frontend forms to API routes to database updates to email
              triggers. Then back through the same chain when the admin
              responded.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>What This Cost</h2>
            <p>
              I participated in all technical meetings to explain implementation
              details. Answered questions about the codebase. Reviewed other
              developers' work. Some of my classes dropped from A to B that
              quarter because I prioritized the nonprofit project.
            </p>
            <p>
              I could have done less. Let the project struggle more. Focused
              only on my coursework. But the nonprofit was counting on us to
              deliver something functional. That felt more important than the
              difference between an A and a B in a class I was passing anyway.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Tech Lead Now</h2>
            <p>
              I'm a Tech Lead for this year's projects. Leading a team building
              for a different nonprofit. The goal is to create an environment
              where developers don't have to struggle with unclear direction or
              figure everything out themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              I know what it's like to be on a team where the technical
              leadership is still learning. It's fine—everyone has to learn
              somewhere. But it means developers either step up or the project
              suffers. I stepped up. Now I want to build something where that's
              less necessary.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>What Nonprofit Work Teaches</h2>
            <p>
              Real users with real needs. Actual deadlines. Code that someone
              else will maintain. These constraints are different from
              coursework or personal projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              In coursework, you can cut corners because only the grade matters.
              In personal projects, you can abandon things when they get boring.
              With a nonprofit client, you commit to delivering something
              functional. That changes how you approach technical decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, explaining technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders
              is its own skill. The Hispanic Business Association staff didn't
              care about our MongoDB schemas or API architecture. They cared
              whether businesses could update their profiles and admins could
              approve changes. Learning to translate between technical
              implementation and user-facing functionality matters more than I
              expected.
            </p>
