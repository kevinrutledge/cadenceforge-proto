          <h2>The Assignment</h2>
          <p>
            Fall 2024, first year back at Cal Poly. I joined Hack4Impact and got
            assigned to build a web application for the Hispanic Business
            Association. The stack was Next.js, TypeScript, MongoDB. I'd used
            some of these before. Others were new.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project had designated tech leads. They were learning how to
            lead while also learning the stack. I was one of the developers. But
            as the project went on, I found myself taking most of the tickets
            and writing most of the code.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>The Work</h2>
          <p>
            The Hispanic Business Association needed a system for managing
            business profiles and membership. Businesses could update their
            information. Admins could review and approve changes. Members needed
            a way to find and connect with other businesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            I built the admin approval system. Request cards, approval
            workflows, email notifications. The business detail pages with
            membership tracking. The API endpoints for updates and approvals.
            AWS S3 integration for logo uploads. MongoDB schemas for request
            history with TTL-based cleanup.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each feature required understanding how the pieces connected.
            Frontend forms to API routes to database updates to email triggers.
            Then back through the same chain when the admin responded.
          </p>
        </section>

          <h2>What This Cost</h2>
          <p>
            I participated in all technical meetings to explain implementation
            details. Answered questions about the codebase. Reviewed other
            developers' work. Some of my classes dropped from A to B that
            quarter because I prioritized the nonprofit project.
          </p>
          <p>
            I could have done less. Let the project struggle more. Focused only
            on my coursework. But the nonprofit was counting on us to deliver
            something functional. That felt more important than the difference
            between an A and a B in a class I was passing anyway.
          </p>
        </section>

          <h2>Tech Lead Now</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a Tech Lead for this year's projects. Leading a team building
            for a different nonprofit. The goal is to create an environment
            where developers don't have to struggle with unclear direction or
            figure everything out themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            I know what it's like to be on a team where the technical leadership
            is still learning. It's fine—everyone has to learn somewhere. But it
            means developers either step up or the project suffers. I stepped
            up. Now I want to build something where that's less necessary.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>What Nonprofit Work Teaches</h2>
          <p>
            Real users with real needs. Actual deadlines. Code that someone else
            will maintain. These constraints are different from coursework or
            personal projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            In coursework, you can cut corners because only the grade matters.
            In personal projects, you can abandon things when they get boring.
            With a nonprofit client, you commit to delivering something
            functional. That changes how you approach technical decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, explaining technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders is
            its own skill. The Hispanic Business Association staff didn't care
            about our MongoDB schemas or API architecture. They cared whether
            businesses could update their profiles and admins could approve
            changes. Learning to translate between technical implementation and
            user-facing functionality matters more than I expected.
