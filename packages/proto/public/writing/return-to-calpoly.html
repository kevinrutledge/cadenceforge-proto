            <h2>2008</h2>
            <p>
              I arrived at Cal Poly as a recruited track athlete with a 790 math
              SAT score. The combination felt right. I could compete and study
              engineering. What I didn't understand was how much time
              engineering coursework actually required.
            </p>
            <p>
              In high school, I'd done homework during class or lunch. Maybe an
              hour at home. That approach worked fine. At Cal Poly, it didn't. I
              failed everything Fall quarter. Because I failed, I couldn't
              compete freshman year despite being recruited specifically for
              track. I was still training 20-30 hours per week with no
              competitive outlet.
            </p>
            <p>
              By Spring quarter I was passing classes, but barely. The
              university told me I needed to take significantly more units to
              make up for Fall. I looked at the situation honestly. I wasn't
              ready for Cal Poly's pace or tuition. I dismissed myself after
              freshman year.
            </p>

            <h2>The Years Between</h2>
            <p>
              I tried community college. Enrolled in calculus, physics,
              chemistry. Dropped integral calculus multiple times when it got
              difficult. Same with general chemistry. I was avoiding the
              discomfort rather than working through it.
            </p>
            <p>
              I coached track for a while. Developed training programs. Worked
              at Milestone Technologies doing warehouse logistics, then QA, then
              analytics. Started ballroom dancing and competed at nationals.
              Went back to school for kinesiology. Did a data analytics
              bootcamp. Tried to find a shortcut to a technical career.
            </p>
            <p>
              None of it was wasted time, but I kept circling back to the same
              realization. I needed to finish the CS degree properly. No
              shortcuts. Just the work.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>What Changed</h2>
            <p>
              At San Jose State for kinesiology, something shifted. I started
              treating coursework the way I'd treated athletic training.
              Allocate the time. Break down the material. Practice until it
              sticks. I got a 3.85 GPA.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I went back to De Anza and Foothill for CS prerequisites, I
              registered for the hardest calculus professor available. If I
              could pass under difficult conditions, I'd be ready for anything.
              I passed Calc II with a B. Calc III, Calc IV, Linear Algebra, all
              As. Data structures and algorithms, A.
            </p>
            <p>
              The material wasn't easier. I was approaching it differently. More
              time, more repetition, less expectation that things should come
              quickly.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>2024</h2>
            <p>
              I got into multiple UCs and Cal Poly again. Chose Cal Poly. Same
              school, different student. My 2008 transcript is still there—those
              failing grades don't disappear. But Fall 2024 I got a 3.9 GPA and
              made Dean's List.
            </p>
            <p>
              The coursework is demanding. Database Systems, Algorithms, Ethics
              and AI, plus Hack4Impact development work. But I know how to study
              now. I allocate 40+ hours per week. I break down complex material
              into pieces I can practice. I don't expect things to be easy.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm 36. Most of my classmates are 20. The age difference is
              obvious in group work sometimes. But the systematic approach to
              learning that took me years to develop works. That's what matters.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>What I'd Tell 2008 Me</h2>
            <p>
              The problem wasn't that you couldn't do the work. The problem was
              thinking you shouldn't have to work that hard. Intelligence
              doesn't mean things come easily. It means you can figure out how
              to learn difficult things if you're willing to put in the time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, stop dropping classes when they get hard. That's when the
              learning actually starts.
            </p>
