            Breaking down triple jump technique taught me how to approach
            dynamic programming.

          <h2>The Pattern in the Jump</h2>
          <p>
            My track coach would stand at the end of the runway with a measuring
            tape and a notebook. He'd mark positions with chalk. We'd drill the
            penultimate step over and over—three lefts, three rights, until the
            muscle memory was automatic. Nothing about triple jump was
            intuitive. Every phase was deliberate, measured, repeated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Years later, sitting in CSC 349 staring at a dynamic programming
            problem, I recognized the same structure. The problem wasn't
            mystical. It just needed to be broken down.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>How You Learn a Jump</h2>
          <p>
            Triple jump has four phases: approach, hop, step, jump. Each phase
            has its own mechanics. The approach isn't just running—it's building
            controlled speed while maintaining posture. The hop requires a
            specific knee angle and arm position. The step needs a penultimate
            adjustment that feels completely unnatural at first.
          </p>
          <p>
            You don't just "do" a triple jump. You drill the hop in isolation. A
            hundred times. You work on the approach without the jump. You
            practice the penultimate step until your body remembers it without
            thinking. Then you start combining pieces. Approach and hop. Hop and
            step. Eventually, the full sequence.
          </p>
          <p>
            My coach would watch, make small corrections, and we'd repeat. The
            feedback loop was constant.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>How You Learn an Algorithm</h2>
          <p>
            Longest Common Subsequence seemed impossible at first. The recursion
            didn't make sense. The table was confusing. The backtracking felt
            arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I broke it down. First, I just worked on understanding the
            recurrence relation. Not the full problem—just that one piece. Then
            I practiced building the table by hand. Multiple times, with
            different inputs, until the pattern became clear. The backtracking
            came later, once the table made sense.
          </p>
          <p>
            Test cases were my coach. Each one showed me where my understanding
            was off. I'd adjust and try again.
          </p>
        </section>

          <h2>The Time Question</h2>
          <p>
            I trained 20-30 hours per week for track. Now I study around 40
            hours per week for upper-division CS courses. People sometimes
            assume the time investment is different for "natural" athletes
            versus students. It's not. The methodology is the same.
          </p>
          <p>
            The difference is that I learned early in athletics that progress
            comes from deliberate repetition. You don't get better at triple
            jump by thinking about it. You get better by doing the drills. You
            isolate the hard parts. You practice them until they're not hard
            anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            It took me longer to apply this to academics. When I dropped out of
            Cal Poly in 2009, I didn't know how to study. I thought intelligence
            meant things should come easily. By the time I came back in 2024, I
            understood that learning is systematic. It requires time,
            repetition, and breaking down complexity into manageable pieces.
          </p>

          <h2>What Transfers</h2>
          <p>
            The approach works for anything complex. Dance, algorithms, system
            design, writing. Find the difficult part. Isolate it. Practice it
            until it's not difficult. Then integrate it back into the whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            This isn't revolutionary. Anders Ericsson documented deliberate
            practice decades ago. But understanding it intellectually is
            different from applying it consistently. Athletics taught me to
            apply it. Now it's just how I learn.
