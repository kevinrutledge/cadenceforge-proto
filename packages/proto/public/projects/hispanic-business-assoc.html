          <h2>The Problem</h2>
          <p>
            The Hispanic Business Association needed a system for managing
            member businesses. Business owners should be able to update their
            information. Admins needed to review and approve changes before they
            went live. Members needed a directory to find other businesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            The existing process used spreadsheets and email. Updates were slow.
            Changes often got lost. There was no audit trail.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>What I Built</h2>

          <h3>Admin Request Management</h3>
          <p>
            Business owners submit change requests. Admins see them in a
            dashboard. They can approve or deny with a message. The system sends
            email notifications. Approved changes update the business profile
            immediately. Request history is stored for 90 days, then
            automatically cleaned up using MongoDB TTL indexes.
          </p>

          <h3>Business Management Interface</h3>
          <p>
            Admin dashboard shows all businesses. Click into a business to see
            details. Edit membership dates, track payments. Changes update
            immediately using SWR cache invalidation. No page reloads needed.
          </p>

          <h3>Media Handling</h3>
          <p>
            Businesses can upload logos and banner images. Files go to AWS S3.
            The approval interface shows before and after images when changes
            are requested. Fallback images handle missing or broken uploads.
          </p>

          <h3>API and Database</h3>
          <p>
            REST API endpoints for request approval, denial, history. MongoDB
            schemas for request tracking with TTL-based expiration. Migrated
            legacy address model to support separate physical and mailing
            addresses.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Technical Decisions</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Next.js App Router:</strong> Server and client rendering in
            one framework. API routes eliminated the need for a separate
            backend.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>MongoDB with TTL indexes:</strong> Request history
            automatically expires after 90 days. No manual cleanup jobs needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>SWR for cache management:</strong> Optimistic updates and
            automatic revalidation. UI stays responsive even with slow network.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Clerk for auth:</strong> User management handled by a
            service. We didn't have to build login, password reset, or session
            management.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>What I Learned</h2>
          <p>
            Real projects have constraints that coursework doesn't. The
            nonprofit had a timeline. Features needed to work, not just
            demonstrate concepts. Code had to be maintainable because other
            developers would work on it after us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Explaining technical decisions to non-technical stakeholders is
            different from explaining them to other developers. The staff didn't
            care about our MongoDB schemas. They cared whether admins could
            approve requests easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, accepting most of the development tickets meant I learned the
            full stack quickly. But it also meant some of my classes dropped
            from A to B that quarter because I prioritized the project. I'd make
            the same choice again. The nonprofit was counting on us.
          </p>
