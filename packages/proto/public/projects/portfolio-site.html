          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>
            Before getting assigned to a real nonprofit project, Hack4Impact
            runs a bootcamp where new members learn the tech stack. The final
            assignment was building a personal portfolio site. It needed a
            welcome page, resume section, blog functionality, project showcase,
            and contact form.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was my first time using Next.js App Router or TypeScript. I'd
            worked with React before, but not this specific setup. MongoDB was
            new too.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>What I Built</h2>

          <h3>Welcome Page</h3>
          <p>
            Landing page with brief introduction and navigation to other
            sections. Nothing fancy. Just needed to be functional and clear.
          </p>

          <h3>Resume Section</h3>
          <p>
            Education, work experience, skills. Static content pulled from a
            data file. Could have made it dynamic with a CMS, but that seemed
            like overengineering for a bootcamp project.
          </p>

          <h3>Blog Functionality</h3>
          <p>
            This is where MongoDB came in. Blog posts stored in the database
            with basic CRUD operations. Could create, edit, and delete posts
            through an admin interface. The blog itself just displayed them in
            reverse chronological order.
          </p>
          <p>
            The admin interface was behind authentication. Used NextAuth for
            that. Worked fine for a bootcamp project, though I learned later
            there are simpler approaches for portfolio sites.
          </p>

          <h3>Project Showcase</h3>
          <p>
            Grid of project cards with descriptions, tech stacks, and links.
            Also pulled from MongoDB. Probably didn't need a database for this
            either, but the bootcamp required demonstrating database
            integration.
          </p>

          <h3>Contact Form</h3>
          <p>
            Form submissions sent to my email via an API route. Used nodemailer.
            Spent more time debugging email delivery than I expected. Learned
            about SPF records and DKIM signatures in the process.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Deployment</h2>
          <p>
            Had to deploy to GitHub Pages as part of the bootcamp requirements.
            This created some complications because GitHub Pages is designed for
            static sites, not Next.js applications with API routes and database
            connections.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ended up exporting a static version for GitHub Pages and hosting the
            API routes separately. Not ideal, but it met the assignment
            requirements.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>What I Learned</h2>
          <p>
            The technical skills were useful. Learning Next.js App Router,
            TypeScript patterns, MongoDB integration. But the more valuable
            lesson was about project scope.
          </p>
          <p>
            A portfolio site doesn't need a database. Static generation with
            markdown files would work better for blog posts. The admin interface
            was unnecessary complexity. I built these things because the
            bootcamp required demonstrating specific technologies, not because
            the project needed them.
          </p>
          <p>
            This matters when building actual applications. Technical decisions
            should serve the project's needs, not demonstrate your knowledge of
            particular tools. The Hispanic Business Association project needed a
            database because the data was dynamic and needed admin management. A
            personal portfolio usually doesn't.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Would I Build It Differently?</h2>
          <p>
            For a real portfolio site, yes. Static generation with MDX for blog
            posts. No database. Simpler deployment. But for a bootcamp learning
            project, the overengineering was fine. The point was learning the
            tools, not building the perfect portfolio.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project served its purpose. I learned the stack well enough to
            contribute effectively to the Hispanic Business Association
            platform. That was the goal.
          </p>
