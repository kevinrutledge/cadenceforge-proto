          <p>
            I'm a computer science student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo,
            graduating in 2026. I'm currently Tech Lead at Hack4Impact, where I
            lead development teams building web applications for nonprofit
            organizations.

          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            I was born in Campbell, California in 1989. Vietnamese mother,
            Irish-English father. Grew up in Los Gatos. Sports were always
            easier than sitting in classrooms.
          </p>
          <p>
            I competed in track and field through high school. Long jump, high
            jump, triple jump. Made it to state runner-up in long jump my senior
            year. Got recruited to Cal Poly for track in 2008.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dropped out after freshman year. The engineering coursework was
            harder than I expected, and I didn't know how to study. Spent the
            next 15 years working various jobs, coaching track, competing in
            ballroom dancing, and eventually figuring out how to approach
            academics systematically.
          </p>
          <p>
            Came back to Cal Poly in 2024. Made Dean's List Fall quarter.
            Graduating 2026.

          <h2>The Name</h2>
          <p>
            Cadence refers to rhythm and systematic repetition. Forge refers to
            building through sustained effort. Track training taught me that
            complex skills can be mastered through methodical breakdown and
            practice. That same approach applies to algorithms, system design,
            and technical problem-solving.
