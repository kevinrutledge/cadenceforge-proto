              <h2>The Problem</h2>
              <p>
                The Hispanic Business Association needed a system for managing
                member businesses. Business owners should be able to update
                their information. Admins needed to review and approve changes
                before they went live. Members needed a directory to find other
                businesses.
              </p>
              <p>
                The existing process used spreadsheets and email. Updates were
                slow. Changes often got lost. There was no audit trail.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>What I Built</h2>

              <h3>Admin Request Management</h3>
              <p>
                Business owners submit change requests. Admins see them in a
                dashboard. They can approve or deny with a message. The system
                sends email notifications. Approved changes update the business
                profile immediately. Request history is stored for 90 days, then
                automatically cleaned up using MongoDB TTL indexes.
              </p>

              <h3>Business Management Interface</h3>
              <p>
                Admin dashboard shows all businesses. Click into a business to
                see details. Edit membership dates, track payments. Changes
                update immediately using SWR cache invalidation. No page reloads
                needed.
              </p>

              <h3>Media Handling</h3>
              <p>
                Businesses can upload logos and banner images. Files go to AWS
                S3. The approval interface shows before and after images when
                changes are requested. Fallback images handle missing or broken
                uploads.
              </p>

              <h3>API and Database</h3>
              <p>
                REST API endpoints for request approval, denial, history.
                MongoDB schemas for request tracking with TTL-based expiration.
                Migrated legacy address model to support separate physical and
                mailing addresses.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>Technical Decisions</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Next.js App Router:</strong> Server and client rendering
                in one framework. API routes eliminated the need for a separate
                backend.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>MongoDB with TTL indexes:</strong> Request history
                automatically expires after 90 days. No manual cleanup jobs
                needed.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>SWR for cache management:</strong> Optimistic updates
                and automatic revalidation. UI stays responsive even with slow
                network.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Clerk for auth:</strong> User management handled by a
                service. We didn't have to build login, password reset, or
                session management.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>What I Learned</h2>
              <p>
                Real projects have constraints that coursework doesn't. The
                nonprofit had a timeline. Features needed to work, not just
                demonstrate concepts. Code had to be maintainable because other
                developers would work on it after us.
              </p>
              <p>
                Explaining technical decisions to non-technical stakeholders is
                different from explaining them to other developers. The staff
                didn't care about our MongoDB schemas. They cared whether admins
                could approve requests easily.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, accepting most of the development tickets meant I learned
                the full stack quickly. But it also meant some of my classes
                dropped from A to B that quarter because I prioritized the
                project. I'd make the same choice again. The nonprofit was
                counting on us.
              </p>
